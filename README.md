# Gamification Plugin for Moodle

**Gamification** is a plugin for Moodle. It helps to increase student engagement by giving points for activities in a course.

## Currently Implemented Features:

### Points and Levels System:
- Points are awarded for completing tasks, participating in forums, and submitting quizzes.
- Points are stored in the database and can be viewed by the user.
- Levels are calculated based on the total points earned by the user.
- A dynamic progress bar shows how close the user is to the next level.

### Badges:
- Users can earn badges for specific achievements in the course.
- Badges are displayed on the dashboard if available.

### Leaderboard:
- A leaderboard is displayed on the dashboard showing the top users in the course based on points.
- The leaderboard includes filters to view data for all time, the past month, or the past week.

### Customization Options:
- Administrators can configure the number of points awarded for completing tasks, forum posts, and quizzes.
- Settings allow administrators to enable or disable the leaderboard display.
- Settings also allow administrators to enable or disable the badges display.

### Localization and Theme Compatibility:
